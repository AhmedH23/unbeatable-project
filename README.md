Unbeatable Project - Overview
Welcome to the Unbeatable Project! Our mission is to deliver a simple and powerful cloud storage solution. 

Here's a brief overview:
Unbeatable Project focuses on simplicity, security, and accessibility. With an easy-to-use interface, robust security measures, and cross-platform access, 
managing your files has never been easier.

Rules of collaboration:
To contribute to the project, create a new branch to make changes, and if the files are being used by another developer, patiently wait till he/she finishes the development
to avoid having merge conflicts and overriding tested code. While do not commit any new big change or feature unless given an approval from the tester, and always provide meaningful and brief description about your changes. 

We value your contributions! If you want to get involved in making Unbeatable Project even better, you are welcome to do so. Your input is crucial to our success. 
Thank you for considering contributing to Unbeatable Project!
