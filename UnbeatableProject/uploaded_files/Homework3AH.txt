1. Based on the code below, answer the following questions:

a. What issues can you identify with the code? The code has a few issues: it doesn't handle errors, tries to do too much in one function, unnecessarily makes a list mutable, and lacks documentation.

b. What refactoring methods would you use on it? To improve it, we should split the function into two: one for reading and one for sorting. We also need to add error handling for file operations, use immutable data structures to prevent unintended changes, and document the functions properly.

c. List 3 different test scenarios that would be useful for verification of the code (you
donâ€™t need to write the tests in code, just explain what they would do). For testing, we can try these three test scenarios: first, test with a valid input file to check if the output file has sorted integers. Second, test with an invalid input file to ensure the code handles errors gracefully. And third, test with a large input file to see if the code performs well without memory or performance issues.
